Although these tools have transformed and enhanced the way we write code, they've also forced us to work in nonstandard syntaxes, bouncing from one compiler to the next as we try to find the perfect build process. But what if there's a better way? Learn how postprocessors and transpilers can revolutionize your code and workflow. If the idea of writing proposed CSS4 and ES7 code today without compromising browser support sounds crazy, you're in for a surprise.",
