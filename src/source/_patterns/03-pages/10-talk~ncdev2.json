Having performance discussions throughout the project lifecycle is one of the best ways to ensure a fast website. And one of the best tools to aid in these discussions is a performance budget. Setting one might seem straight forward, but how do they hold up on real world projects that run up against various stakeholders, teams of developers, CMS’s that allow components to be dropped anywhere, and beta and production environments with varying speeds? In this talk, we’ll discuss how to set performance budgets that deliver great experiences in real world environments.",
